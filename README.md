How to install ReNorfolk

ReNorfolk is a bot made by me for Legacy 1.20 because we all know we **HATE** manual rerolling! anyways heres a video tutorial in the desc - **and also an update MAKE sure to also select storm motion and srh in your thermodynamics region if you are going to use those parameters.**

**!! also i am NOT responsible if someone modifies this to make this reroll bot work for another game !!**

**MAJOR QOL UPDATE**

**THE PRIOR LAKE TEXT CALIBRATION IS NOW MOVED TO WITHIN THE PROGRAM ON V1.15 SO REGION_FINDER IS NO LONGER NEEDED!**

Requires Tesseract-OCR
Requires AutoHotKey V1 and V2
