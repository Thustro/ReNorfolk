How to install ReNorfolk

ReNorfolk is a bot made by me for Legacy 1.20 because we all know we HATE manual rerolling! anyways heres a video tutorial in the desc - and also an update MAKE sure to also select storm motion and srh in your thermodynamics region if you are going to use those parameters.

!! also i am NOT responsible if someone modifies this to make this reroll bot work for another game !!

Requires Tesseract-OCR
Requires AutoHotKey V1 and V2
